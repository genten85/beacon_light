        UW Tacoma's Masters in Geospatial Technologies program is designed so
        students can 1) develop a set of skills that enable them to become
        proficient in the geospatial tech field, and 2) have a foundational
        knowledge of the field which encompasses understanding strengths and
        limitations of applicability. Students are expected to demonstrate these
        two in real-world scenarios. The program encompasses advanced GIS, web
        and app development, software and hardware, and project management and
        administration. More information about the program can be found

        My partial interest in GIS is to advance and promote the interests of
        social work and welfare through spatial research. I am currently
        employed through UW Tacoma’s Action Mapping Project (AMP), which
        involves performing GIS work that is meant to inspire and promote change
        specific for disadvantaged populations. One of the projects I am working
        on, in collaboration with United Way Pierce County involve a) compiling,
        adding, and processing relevant information into ArcMap; b) visualizing
        data, particularly the percentage of ALICE (Asset Limited, Income
        Constrained, Employed) families at the zip code boundary; and c)
        performing spatial analysis that identifies gaps involving community
        organizations and impacted families. Providing community organizations
        like United Way with these services to identify areas of strength and
        gaps is crucial in communicating and informing the way they support or
        represent populations they serve to its audience.<br /><br />
        My capstone draws from the inspirations of my work with AMP, which
        involves creating a product that can visualize the social inequality ALICE families experience in various parts of the United States. Having readily accessible information related to resource allocation and funding can lead to organizational efficiency.
        A mixed-methods approach will be used to a) visualize opportunity at granular geographical boundary levels, b) visualize
        structural barriers that impede access to opportunity, and c) blend the two concepts to provide a more comprehensive
        conception of opportunity. The outcome is a product interface that organizes spatial and non-spatial information to
        communicate United Way’s goals and performance regarding the ALICE Initiative to community organizations,
        philanthropists, and policymakers.<br><br>
