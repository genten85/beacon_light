        UW Tacoma's Masters in Geospatial Technologies program is designed so
        students can 1) develop a set of skills that enable them to become
        proficient in the geospatial tech field, and 2) have a foundational
        knowledge of the field which encompasses understanding strengths and
        limitations of applicability. Students are expected to demonstrate these
        two in real-world scenarios. The program encompasses advanced GIS, web
        and app development, software and hardware, and project management and
        administration. More information about the program can be found

        My partial interest in GIS is to advance and promote the interests of
        social work and welfare through spatial research. I am currently
        employed through UW Tacoma’s Action Mapping Project (AMP), which
        involves performing GIS work that is meant to inspire and promote change
        specific for disadvantaged populations. One of the projects I am working
        on, in collaboration with United Way Pierce County involve a) compiling,
        adding, and processing relevant information into ArcMap; b) visualizing
        data, particularly the percentage of ALICE (Asset Limited, Income
        Constrained, Employed) families at the zip code boundary; and c)
        performing spatial analysis that identifies gaps involving community
        organizations and impacted families. Providing community organizations
        like United Way with these services to identify areas of strength and
        gaps is crucial in communicating and informing the way they support or
        represent populations they serve to its audience.<br /><br />
        My capstone draws from the inspirations of my work with AMP, which
        involves creating a product that can automate the processing and
        visualization of information pertaining to the social inequality
        experienced in ALICE families in various parts of the United States. In
        addition, this product will spatially analyze and quantify the impact
        other variables may have on these families, such as distance to bus
        stops, service agencies, and toxic release sites. What one can find out
        with this product is how vulnerable ALICE families can be when examined
        in more granular scales as opposed to greater areal boundaries, what
        assumptions about ALICE methodology could be challenged or amended with
        this product, and what are the product’s limitations in ascertaining
        these results? Not only are families struggling due to their inability
        to afford necessities, but there are social and environmental conditions
        that are keeping them in the socioeconomic status they are in.
        Understanding these conditions may better inform the priorities of
        United Way in how it can better serve its communities.
