A geographic information system (GIS) is a computer-based tool for mapping and analyzing things that exist and events
that happen on earth. GIS technology integrates common database operations such as query and statistical analysis with
the unique visualization and geographic analysis benefits offered by maps. These abilities distinguish GIS from other
information systems and make it valuable to a wide range of public and private enterprises for explaining events,
predicting outcomes and planning strategies.<br><br>

The University of Washington Tacoma offers 5 courses leading to a certificate in Geographic Information Systems (GIS).
The certificate program is a 25-credit curriculum which begins with T GIS 311, Maps and GIS, taken any quarter (Autumn,
Winter, Spring or Summer) and serves as a prerequisite for subsequent courses.<br><br>


Acquired skills and competencies:<br><br>

Maps & GIS<br>
> Be familiar with GIS as a tool and as a concept. We will be using ArcGIS Advanced for Desktop version
10.5, ArcGIS Online (AGOL) and ArcGIS Pro 2.1.2 in this course. Esri ArcGIS products are the leading professional GIS
software package available.<br>
> Be familiar with spatial data – ways to collect, store, manipulate and analyze.<br>
> Be familiar with spatial analysis – ways
of
visualizing and reading spatial data using a GIS.<br><br>

Intermediate GIS<br>
> Be proficient in <a href="AAA_genten85_Lab_1b_Final.pdf" target="blank">vector</a> <a href="AAA_genten85_Lab_2_Final.pdf" target="blank">and</a> <a href="AAA_genten85_Lab_3_Final.pdf" target="blank">raster</a> <a href="AAA_genten85_Lab_4_Final.pdf" target="blank">based</a> <a href="AAA_Group_11_Lab_5_Poster.pdf" target="blank">spatial</a> data analysis.<br>
> Be comfortable using the following ArcGIS tools and
extensions: Spatial Analyst, 3D Analyst, ArcScene<br>
> Understand different spatial data models and ways to organize them.<br><br>

Applied GIS and Project Design<br>
> Participate in small group discussions about possible research ideas.<br> 
> Present your own research ideas to the rest
of the class.<br> 
> Provide constructive feedback to others in the class who present their own ideas.<br><br>

Advanced Applications of GIS<br>
> Be proficient in both vector and raster based spatial data analysis.<br>
> Have developed an increased familiarity with the
following ArcGIS tools and extensions: Spatial Analyst, <a href="AAA_Group_11_Lab_6_Poster.pdf" target="blank">3D Analyst</a>, ArcScene, ArcCatalog, ArcGIS Online and ArcPro.<br>
> Be comfortable using the following tools, extensions and techniques: Map Design, <a href="AAA_Group_11_Lab_7_Poster.pdf" target="blank">LiDAR analysis</a>, Model Builder, Map Algebra,
Ortho-rectification, Digitization, Cost surface analysis and MapPlex.<br>
> Have gained a solid understanding of the various
methods and techniques that are available in a GIS to conduct analysis and visualization of spatial data.<br><br>

Critical Theory and GIS Practicum<br>

> Grasp the foundational debates that have led to the emergence of Critical GIS research.<br>
> Understand how critical GIS research can be operationalized and used to inform your own <a href="Tran.pdf" target="blank">GIS related work.</a><br>
> Be comfortable providing support and feedback to other GIS-driven research projects.
