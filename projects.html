          GIS is a framework which encompasses data collection, analysis,
          visualization, storage, and sharing in a manner that propogates
          spatial knowledge. The field's potential and applicability can
          possibly address the spatial and mapping needs of people and
          communities. <br /><br />
          Geospatial technologies is a subfield in which advanced GIS skills,
          software development, and data management creates efficiency in
          resolving problems. Web and mobile app development, geo-visualization,
          automating and customizing geospatial tech are some of the skills
          relevant in the field. <br /><br />
          There are many opportunities in personal and work experience in which
          I learn and express with GIS. As administrator for UW Tacoma's Action
          Mapping Project, I get to collaborate with different people, promote
          ideas and interests respective to them, and further improve my
          community.

          A geographic information system (GIS) is a computer-based tool for
          mapping and analyzing things that exist and events that happen on
          earth. GIS technology integrates common database operations such as
          query and statistical analysis with the unique visualization and
          geographic analysis benefits offered by maps. These abilities
          distinguish GIS from other information systems and make it valuable to
          a wide range of public and private enterprises for explaining events,
          predicting outcomes and planning strategies.<br /><br />

          The University of Washington Tacoma offers 5 courses leading to a
          certificate in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The certificate
          program is a 25-credit curriculum which begins with T GIS 311, Maps
          and GIS, taken any quarter (Autumn, Winter, Spring or Summer) and
          serves as a prerequisite for subsequent courses.<br /><br />

          UW Tacoma's Masters in Geospatial Technologies program is designed so
          students can 1) develop a set of skills that enable them to become
          proficient in the geospatial tech field, and 2) have a foundational
          knowledge of the field which encompasses understanding strengths and
          limitations of applicability. Students are expected to demonstrate
          these two in real-world scenarios. The program encompasses advanced
          GIS, web and app development, software and hardware, and project
          management and administration. More information about the program can

          My partial interest in GIS is to advance and promote the interests of
          social work and welfare through spatial research. I am currently
          employed through UW Tacoma’s Action Mapping Project (AMP), which
          involves performing GIS work that is meant to inspire and promote
          change specific for disadvantaged populations. One of the projects I
          am working on, in collaboration with United Way of Pierce County
          involve a) compiling, adding, and processing relevant information into
          ArcMap; b) visualizing data, particularly the percentage of ALICE
          (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed) families at the zip code
          boundary; and c) performing spatial analysis that identifies gaps
          involving community organizations and impacted families. Providing
          community organizations like United Way with these services to
          identify areas of strength and gaps is crucial in communicating and
          informing the way they support or represent populations they serve to
          its audience.<br /><br />
          My capstone draws from the inspirations of my work with AMP, which
          involves creating a product that can visualize the social inequality
          ALICE families experience in various parts of the United States.
          Having readily accessible information related to resource allocation
          and funding can lead to organizational efficiency. A qualitative
          analysis is used to a) visualize opportunity in these locations at the
          block group level, b) identify ‘technological companies’ that
          influence the allocation of opportunities, and c) identify patterns or
          implications after these two concepts of opportunity are juxtaposed.
          The product has been hosted on

          AMP (Action Mapping Project) collaborates with public and private
          organizations to promote a positive impact on youth and the community
          in Pierce County. AMP promotes participatory GIS where youth map their
          community. The data and information collected is used for analysis,
          sharing, and collaboration in a manner that promotes policychanges.

          <a href="http://actionmappingproject.com/mission.html" target="blank"
            >here!</a
          ><br /><br />

          My work with AMP is based on a separate funding stream, which involves
          collaboration with United Way of Pierce County. My responsibilities
          are:<br /><br />

          1) To collect data involving United Way of Piece County, based on the
          following categories: approved agencies, strong families, and
          community impact partners.<br />
          2) Collect relevant Census data to a) generate a spatial layer of
          ALICE households at the block group scale for Pierce County, then b)
          convert the data in a manner that can be presented in zip code
          scale.<br />
          3) Create a set of <a href="United_Way_Pierce.pdf">maps</a> that
          reflect relevant information for stakeholders and donors to read (Vol
          of 211 Calls per ALICE family count, percentage of ALICE families, and
          median family incomes).<br /><br />

          As of 6/1/2020, I am working with United Way Pierce County to design a
          workable, communicable Tableau dashboard that:<br /><br />
          > Provide information that communicates the progress of United Way
          towards its audience.<br />
          > Provide information that communicate the gaps in United Way's
          initiatives.<br />
          > Functions and efficiently meet the needs in the daily operations of
          United Way Pierce County.<br /><br />

          The Tableau dashboard is expected to be completed before the end of
          August.
