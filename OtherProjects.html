        AMP (Action Mapping Project) collaborates with public and private
        organizations to promote a positive impact on youth and the community in
        Pierce County. AMP promotes participatory GIS where youth map their
        community. The data and information collected is used for analysis,
        sharing, and collaboration in a manner that promotes policychanges. More
        information can be found

        ><br /><br />

        My work with AMP is based on a separate funding stream, which involves
        collaboration with United Way of Pierce County. My responsibilities
        are:<br /><br />

        1) To collect data involving United Way of Piece County, based on the
        following categories: approved agencies, strong families, and community
        impact partners.<br />
        2) Collect relevant Census data to a) generate a spatial layer of ALICE
        households at the block group scale for Pierce County, then b) convert
        the data in a manner that can be presented in zip code scale.<br />
        3) Create a set of <a href="United_Way_Pierce.pdf">maps</a> that reflect relevant information for
        stakeholders and donors to read (Vol of 211 Calls per ALICE family
        count, percentage of ALICE families, and median family incomes).<br /><br />
        
        As of 6/1/2020, I am working with United Way Pierce County to design a workable, communicable Tableau dashboard that:<br /><br />
        > Provide information that communicates the progress of United Way towards its audience.<br />
        > Provide information that communicate the gaps in United Way's initiatives.<br />
        > Functions and efficiently meet the needs in the daily operations of United Way Pierce County.<br /><br />

        The Tableau dashboard is expected to be completed before the end of August.
